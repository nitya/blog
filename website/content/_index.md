## Thanks for stopping by!
Hi 👋🏽! I'm Nitya - a PhD, Parent, and Polyglot, based in New York, USA. Welcome!

I have 25+ years of technology research, development and advocacy experience across industry, startups and academia. If I think about _connecting the dots_ across my various projects and roles, it comes down to one mission statement - I like to **Help. People. Learn.** Learn to speak. Learn to visualize. Learn to innovate. Learn to build. Learn self-care. Learn documentation. Learn rapid prototyping. Learn _how to learn continuiously_ so you are resilient to change and receptive to growth opportunities.

I hope to use this blog to tell my stories. And I hope you will share yours with me.

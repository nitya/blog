# Choose Blog Platform

In starting this blog, I looked for a platform and theme with the following features:

- [X] Minimal and clean apperance
- [X] Accessible by default with _fast_ build/deploy times
- [X] Support RSS feeds, tags, time-to-read, author profiles
- [X] Integrated social sharing (open graph, buttons, analytics)
- [X] Markdown-based content (with support for custom templates)
- [X] Deploy to GitHub pages (now) and other static hosting services (later)
- [X] Long term stability (with good community support & tooling)

My options came down to three specific platforms:
 1. **[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io)** |  React based static site framework that is a rising start in JavaScript circles. Benefits are ease of setup, MDX (use Markdown and React components) and familiarity (I've used it a lot). The drawbacks are limited themes, overkill for just a blog (great for documentation sites) and likely to get slower in builds as content grows.
 2. **[Astro](https://docusaurus.io)** | Another [rising star](https://risingstars.js.org/2022/en#section-ssg) in JavaScript-based static site generators. Is designed for speed, works well with other components, and highlights sustainability (low carbon footprint) as key differentiators. Using it for a blog also gives me a forcing function to learn its capability in practice. The downside is that it is JavaScript and fairly new, so expect constant changes and evolition.

 3. **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io)** | My [original go-to](https://nitya.github.io/learn-playwright/) for blogs and a perennial title-holder foro the _fastest framework for building websites_. Benefits are speed,large & stable community with [many themes & templates](https://themes.gohugo.io/), and built-in support for Markdown and templated content. Downside is that its based on Golang which I am less familiar with.
